    <h2>Distributions</h2>

    <p>
      A histogram subdivides a numerical range into bins, and counts the number
      of data points with each segment. The resulting bar chart provides a
      discrete estimate of the probability density function.
    </p>
    <div id="histo1" class="view"></div>

    <p>
      This example demonstrates a histogram over a numerical range, with a
      segment to show the prevalence of null values.
    </p>
    <div id="histo2" class="view"></div>

    <p>
      Visual comparison of estimated probability distributions for a sample of
      numeric values. A normal (Gaussian) distribution parameterized by the mean
      and standard deviation, and a kernel density estimate. This example
      supports estimates of either probability density functions (pdf) or
      cumulative distribution functions (cdf), using Vega’s density transform.
    </p>
    <div id="density1" class="view"></div>

    <p>
      A box plot summarizes a distribution of quantitative values using a set of
      summary statistics. Here, the boxes show the interquartile range (IQR),
      with the white bar indicating the median value. The thin lines
      (“whiskers”) currently show the extent of the minimum and maximum values;
      other values, such as whiskers extending 1.5 * IQR from each end of the
      box, are often used as well. See the violin plot example for an
      alternative approach.
    </p>
    <div id="boxplot1" class="view"></div>

    <p>
      A violin plot visualizes a distribution of quantitative values as a
      continuous approximation of the probability density function, computed
      using kernel density estimation (KDE). The densities are additionally
      annotated with the median value and interquartile range, shown as black
      lines. Violin plots can be more informative than classical box plots.
    </p>

    <p>
      A plot of the top-k film directors by aggregate worldwide gross. Performs
      an aggregation of all directors, ranks them, and filters to only the top
      results, using the 'window' transform.
    </p>
    <div id="window1" class="view"></div>

    <p>
      A plot of the top-k film directors, plus all other directors, by aggregate
      worldwide gross. Unlike the previous example, this chart includes a
      category of all other directors aggregated together. The visualization
      spec first computes aggregates for all directors and ranks them. It then
      copies these ranks back to the source data using a lookup transform, and
      determines which directors belong in the “other” category before
      performing a final aggregation.
    </p>
    <div id="window2" class="view"></div>

    <p>
      A binned scatterplot is a more scalable alternative to the standard
      scatter plot. The data points are grouped into bins, and an aggregate
      statistic is used to summarize each bin. Here we use a circular area
      encoding to depict the count of records, visualizing the density of data
      points. For higher bin counts color might instead be used, though with
      some loss of perceptual comparison accuracy.
    </p>
    <div id="scatter1" class="view"></div>

    <p>
      A contour plot depicts the density of data points using a set of discrete
      levels. Akin to contour lines on topographic maps, each contour boundary
      is an isoline of constant density. Kernel density estimation is performed
      to generate a continuous approximation of the sample density.
    </p>
    <div id="contour1" class="view"></div>

    <p>
      A wheat plot is an alternative to standard dot plots and histograms that
      incorporates aspects of both. The x-coordinate of a point is based on its
      exact value. The y-coordinate is determined by grouping points into
      histogram bins, then stacking them based on their rank order within each
      bin. While not scalable to large numbers of data points, wheat plots allow
      inspection of (and interaction with) individual points without
      overplotting.
    </p>
    <div id="wheat1" class="view"></div>

    <p>
      Rather than showing a continuous probability distribution, Hypothetical
      Outcome Plots (or HOPs) visualize a set of draws from a distribution,
      where each draw is shown as a new plot in either a small multiples or
      animated form.
    </p>
    <p>
      This example – inspired by The New York Times – displays random draws for
      a simulated time-series of values (these could be sales or employment
      statistics). The noise signal determines the amount of random variation
      added to the signal. The trend signal determines the strength of a linear
      trend, where zero corresponds to no trend at all (a flat uniform
      distribution). When the noise is high enough, draws from a distribution
      without any underlying trend may cause us to “hallucinate” interesting
      variations. Viewing the different frames may help viewers get a more
      intuitive sense of random variation.
