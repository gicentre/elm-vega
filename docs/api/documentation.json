While this a 'pure' Elm library, to create the graphical output you\nprobably want to send a Vega-Lite specification generated by `toVegaLite` via a\nport to some JavaScript that invokes the Vega-Lite runtime.\n\n\n# Creating A Vega-Lite Specification\n\n@docs toVegaLite\n@docs VLProperty\n@docs Spec\n@docs LabelledSpec\n@docs combineSpecs\n\n\n# Creating the Data Specification\n\nFunctions and types for declaring the input data to the visualization.\n\n@docs dataFromUrl\n@docs dataFromColumns\n@docs dataFromRows\n@docs dataFromJson\n@docs dataFromSource\n@docs datasets\n@docs dataColumn\n@docs dataRow\n@docs geometry\n@docs geoFeatureCollection\n@docs geometryCollection\n@docs Data\n@docs DataColumn\n@docs DataRow\n@docs Format\n@docs Geometry\n@docs DataType\n\n\n# Creating the Transform Specification\n\nFunctions and types for declaring the transformation rules that are applied to\ndata fields or geospatial coordinates before they are encoded visually.\n\n@docs transform\n@docs projection\n@docs ProjectionProperty\n@docs Projection\n@docs ClipRect\n\n\n## Aggregation\n\n@docs aggregate\n@docs Operation\n@docs opAs\n@docs timeUnitAs\n\n\n## Binning\n\n@docs bin\n@docs binAs\n@docs BinProperty\n\n\n## Data Calculation\n\n@docs calculateAs\n\n\n## Filtering\n\n@docs filter\n@docs Filter\n@docs FilterRange\n\n\n## Relational Joining (lookup)\n\n@docs lookup\n@docs lookupAs\n\n\n# Creating the Mark Specification\n\nFunctions and types for declaring the type of visual marks used in the visualization.\nThe preferred method of specifying mark types is to call the relevant mark function\n(e.g. `bar`, `line` etc.) rather than `mark Bar`, `mark Line` etc.\n\n@docs area\n@docs bar\n@docs circle\n@docs geoshape\n@docs line\n@docs point\n@docs rect\n@docs rule\n@docs square\n@docs textMark\n@docs tick\n@docs trail\n\n@docs MarkProperty\n@docs MarkOrientation\n@docs MarkInterpolation\n@docs Symbol\n@docs Cursor\n\nThe following are deprecated and will be removed in a future major version release.\n\n@docs mark\n@docs Mark\n\n\n# Creating the Encoding Specification\n\nTypes and functions for declaring which data fields are mapped to which channels.\nChannels can include position on screen (e.g. `X`,`Y`), visual mark properties\n(e.g. color, size, stroke, shape), text, hyperlinks, ordering, level of detail and facets\n(for composed visualizations).

Note that unlike most other\nchannels, the hyperlink channel has no direct visual expression other than the\noption of changing the cursor style when hovering, so an encoding will usually\npair hyperlinks with other visual channels such as marks or texts.\n\n@docs hyperlink\n@docs HyperlinkChannel\n\n\n## Order channels\n\nChannels that relate to the order of data fields such as for sorting stacking order\nor order of data points in a connected scatterplot. See the\n[Vega-Lite documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/encoding.html#order)\nfor further details.\n\n@docs order\n@docs OrderChannel\n\n\n## Facet channels\n\nChannels for faceting single plots into small multiples. Can be used to create\ntrellis plots or other arrangements in rows and columns. See the\n[Vega-Lite documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/encoding.html#facet)\nfor further details. See also, 'faceted view composition' for a more flexible (but\nmore verbose) way of defining faceted views.\n\n@docs row\n@docs column\n\n\n## Level of detail Channel\n\nUsed for grouping data but without changing the visual appearance of a mark. When,\nfor example, a field is encoded by color, all data items with the same value for\nthat field are given the same color. When a detail channel encodes a field, all\ndata items with the same value are placed in the same group. This allows, for example\na line chart with multiple lines to be created – one for each group. See the\n[Vega-Lite documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/encoding.html#detail)\nfor more information.\n\n@docs detail\n@docs DetailChannel\n\n\n## Scaling\n\nUsed to specify how the encoding of a data field should be applied.\n\n@docs ScaleProperty\n@docs Scale\n@docs categoricalDomainMap\n@docs domainRangeMap\n@docs ScaleDomain\n@docs ScaleRange\n@docs ScaleNice\n@docs CInterpolate\n\n\n# Creating view compositions\n\nViews can be combined to create more complex multiview displays. This may involve\nlayering views on top of each other (superposition) or laying them out in adjacent\nspaces (juxtaposition using `repeat`, `facet`, `hConcat` or `vConcat`). Where different\nviews have potentially conflicting channels (for example, two position scales in\na layered visualization) the rules for resolving them can be defined with `resolve`.\nFor details of creating composite views see the\n[Vega-Lite documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/composition.html)\n\n@docs layer\n@docs hConcat\n@docs vConcat\n@docs resolve\n@docs resolution\n@docs Resolve\n@docs Channel\n@docs Resolution\n\n\n## Faceted views\n\nThese are small multiples each of which show subsets of the same dataset. The specification\ndetermines which field should be used to determine subsets along with their spatial\narrangement (in rows or columns).

They transform interactions into data queries.\nFor details, see the\n[Vega-Lite documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/selection.html).\n\n@docs selection\n@docs select\n@docs Selection\n@docs SelectionProperty\n@docs Binding\n@docs InputProperty\n@docs SelectionResolution\n@docs SelectionMarkProperty\n\n\n## Making conditional channel encodings\n\nSometimes it is useful to make channel encoding conditional on something. For example,\non the result of some interaction such as clicking or dragging or some data property\nsuch whether null or an outlier. `MSelectionCondition` (and `TSelectionCondition`) will\nencode a mark (or text) dependent on an interactive selection. `MDataCondition`\n(and `TDataCondition`) will encode it dependening on some data property.\n\nFor interaction, once a selection has been defined and named, supplying a set of\n`MSelectionCondition` encodings allow mark encodings to become dependent on that selection.\n`MSelectionCondition` is followed firstly by a Boolean expression relating to the\nselection upon which it is dependent, then an 'if' and an 'else' clause. Each clause\nis a list of mark field encodings that should be applied when the selection is true\n(the 'if clause') and when it is false (the 'else clause'). The color encoding below\nis saying \"whenever data marks are selected with an interval mouse drag, encode\nthe cylinder field with an ordinal color scheme, else make them grey\".\n\n      sel =\n          selection << select \"myBrush\" Interval []\n\n      enc =\n          encoding\n              << position X [ pName \"Horsepower\", pMType Quantitative ]\n              << position Y [ pName \"Miles_per_Gallon\", pMType Quantitative ]\n              << color\n                  [ mSelectionCondition (selectionName \"myBrush\")\n                      [ mName \"Cylinders\", mMType Ordinal ]\n                      [ mString \"grey\" ]\n                  ]\n\nIn a similar way, `MDataCondition` will encocode a mark in one of two ways depending\non whether a predicate test is satisfied.\n\n      enc =\n          encoding\n              << position X [ pName \"IMDB_Rating\", pMType Quantitative ]\n              << position Y [ pName \"Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating\", pMType Quantitative ]\n                << color\n                    [ mDataCondition\n                        (or (expr \"datum.IMDB_Rating === null\")\n                            (expr \"datum.Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating === null\")\n                        )\n                        [ mString \"#ddd\" ]\n                        [ mString \"#0099ee\" ]\n                    ]\n\nFor details, see the\n[Vega-Lite documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/condition.html).\n\n@docs and\n@docs or\n@docs not\n@docs expr\n@docs selected\n@docs selectionName\n\n@docs BooleanOp\n\n\n# Global Configuration\n\nConfiguration options that affect the entire visualization.

Commonly these will include at least\na data, mark and encoding specification.\n\nWhile simple functions like `bar` may be provided directly, it is usually clearer\nto label more complex ones such as encodings as separate expressions. This becomes\nincreasingly helpful for visualizations that involve composition of layers, repeats\nand facets.\n\nSpecifications can be built up by chaining a series of functions (such as `dataColumn`\nor `position` in the example below).
